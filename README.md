# BitcoinPricePrediction

The zip file consists of 

1. 'img' folder for storing the images of the result. 
2. bitcoinprediction.ipynb file that has all the code.
3. bitcoin.csv file, generated as a result of the code in the data fetching process.

The python notebook file is well documented with comments. I am working on fetching of data from mongo db.
